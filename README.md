# Fonky Chat
Place where you can communicate with fonky people. We are connected with music. There are no any mind borders or music style restrictions in here. Just be yourself

## Technial features
- Login/Sign up with social medias: Facebook, Google, GitHub. Well, to put it simple, implemented OAuth 2.0 flow.

## Installation

Install dependecies
```
npm run i
```

## Start an app
Run the application in dev mode:
```
npm run serve
```
All changes are automatically applied. So, you don't need to manually restart an app to reflect changes. `nodemon` will do it for you.

## Testing
Our testing environment built upon [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) tools.

Run all test files
```
npm test
```

Use the following command if you want to run a specific test file:
```
npx mocha ./some-dir/your.spec.js
```

> We use `.spec.js` extension for our test files.

## Build for production (not implemented yet)

```
npm run build
```
